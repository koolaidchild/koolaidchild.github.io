        <p class="white">Welcome to my new blog, everyone! I'll be using this website to be posting interesting things I see and witness, so the everyone reading may gain some insight on my life! Today I was walking by Pompey's Theatre when I heard a loud, exasperated cry that sounded something along the lines of "Et tu, Brute?" I didn't think much of it then, but later when it was found out that our Roman leader, Julius Caesar, had been killed, I questioned if it was his shriek I heard. After all, Brutus' (Caesar's assistant) name was cried out so I'm guessing he was there. Let me know if you guys have any thoughts on this! I'm very busy so I probably won't post for a while...</p>

        <p class="white">Hey everyone! Today I just witnessed something spectacular! There was this random star that just popped in the sky while I was on my camel ride to Bethlehem! Then these magical creatures with wings came down from the sky and blasted trumpets and we were all like, 'What is going on?'. Anyways, once I got to this hole-in-the-wall barn to deliver this jar of myrrh for this special baby, I was so tired so I went to stay in an inn. Then I had make this really long journey back to my family and that's where I'm writing now! Tune in later for another story!</p>
